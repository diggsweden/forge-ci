# Resource-aware asynchronous live campaigns

## Plan before launch

Build a short lane table with provider/road, case, frozen candidate, prerequisites,
mutable repository/package coordinates, expected peak RAM/CPU/disk, and evidence
destination. Read Forge Lab's current `AGENTS.md` and documented recipes before
operating its providers or runners.

Inspect host available memory, CPU/load, free disk, active jobs and runner
concurrency/limits. Forge Lab's read-only doctor/status interfaces and host
metrics provide the observations; configured runner limits and previous measured
peaks provide the budgets. Leave explicit headroom for the forges, compiler work
and cleanup. Unknown memory cost is a reason for a conservative budget, not for
assuming every CPU can host another Maven build.

Choose ready cases that fit the remaining budget. Independent Forgejo, GitLab
and hosted GitHub work should normally overlap. Hosted jobs consume remote
runner capacity, while their local orchestration, compilation and image
preparation still consume local resources. Reassess after each completion or
resource failure and start another compatible case instead of waiting behind an
unrelated provider.

## Execution scopes and locks

Focused local suites support `FORGE_CI_LIVE_PROVIDER=forgejo` or `gitlab`.
Selection is checked by Go preflight, runtime provider selection and runner
architecture selection. A single-provider run cannot claim the full profile.
The retained report names its execution provider and preserves the complete
contract identity/provenance. Read each lane's outcome from the `verdict.json`
beside its log; an `infrastructure` verdict is the lab's failure, not the
product's: fix the lab and run the case again rather than counting it either way.

The launcher takes the existing `live.lock` shared and its provider lock
exclusive. Different providers can overlap; the same provider remains exclusive
because fixtures use fixed repository names. Unscoped/all-provider and older
launchers take `live.lock` exclusively, so mixed old/new runs still conflict
safely. Locks remain held through test cleanup and are not inherited by suites
or loggers. Never unlink a lock file or split HOME/XDG to create concurrency.

For GitHub, use the guarded Forge Lab hosted session recipe and its own
organization lock; shared SDK preparation precedes parallel read-only reuse by
independent consumers.

## Run a campaign

Prepare once, from a clean checkout whose engine checksum is fresh. It
publishes the kaniko job, signer and named nanolinter job images with Forge
Lab, saves the signer and go/java runtime image archives, exports every demo
as a one-commit checkout and writes `<dir>/campaign.env` (references and
paths, no secrets, and `CAMPAIGN_COMMIT`):

```bash
just campaign-prepare ~/src/forge-lab ~/campaigns/k3s \
  job-image=go:<local image> job-image=java:<local image> \
  job-image=javascript-typescript:<local image> job-image=rust:<local image>
```

Then run one lane a provider, side by side, against fresh forgeci targets
(minted with `LAB_ROAD=k3s` in Forge Lab for that road). `LAB_TARGETS_FILE` and
`FORGE_CI_LIVE_CONSUMER_VISIBILITY` stay the caller's:

```bash
export FORGE_CI_LIVE_CONSUMER_VISIBILITY=private
just campaign-lane ~/campaigns/k3s forgejo test/live/campaigns/k3s-private-forgejo.cases &
just campaign-lane ~/campaigns/k3s gitlab test/live/campaigns/k3s-private-gitlab.cases &
wait
```

A cases file holds one case a line: `consumer <demo> <pull-request|release>
[key=value ...]` or `scenario <TestName>`. A value `@NAME` is campaign.env's
`NAME`; a GitLab consumer names its archives with `job-archive=` (and for a
release `build-archive=` and `signer-archive=`). The live preflight reads both
files as data and plans the lane (`internal/livetest/campaign.go`); it refuses
a checkout other than `CAMPAIGN_COMMIT` and any case it cannot read before the
first runs. The lane then runs past failures and fails when any case did. Read the outcome from
`<dir>/<provider>.results`, one tab-separated line a case: interval, case,
exit status and the `verdict.json` to read, as above.

## Shared dependencies

Provider separation alone does not prove independence. Target rotation, runner
reconciliation, package coordinates, local image builds and backing services can
be shared. In particular, the Compose runner's shared network and a `docker`
service alias can collide across jobs. Serialize that resource or choose cases
that do not require it; keep other ready lanes moving.

Record intentional serialization and its dependency/capacity reason. Keep source
snapshots immutable during runs and preserve actual statuses, findings and
cleanup receipts. Result classification is implemented in Go; a package-level
PASS with only skipped scenarios is not a successful live lane.
